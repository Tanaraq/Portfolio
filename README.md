# portfolio-site

I created this site as a personal portfolio-site for a VERY demanding customer: me.

## Techniques used:

HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## What I learned from this project:

- to bring those 3 languages together in a single-page website
- to create a functional, responsive website
- to be very precise in finishing the details
