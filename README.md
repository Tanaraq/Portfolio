# portfolio-site

I created this site as a personal portfolio-site for a VERY demanding customer: me.

## Techniques used:

HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## What I learned from this project:

- to bring it all together
- to create functional, responsive website
- to be very precise in finishing the details
